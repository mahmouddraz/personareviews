The decor is thoughtfully designed, with movie-themed pictures on the walls and lighting that gives the space a cinematic feel\u2014almost like being on a film set.\n\nThe coffee was excellent, definitely a strong point of the place. However, the overall experience was a bit disappointing due to the unfriendly staff. A more welcoming attitude would make a big difference. Also, the cleanliness could be improved, as the space didn\u2019t feel as well-maintained as it should be.\n\nGreat concept and great coffee, but there\u2019s room for improvement in service."}, "Daryna Sereda": {"rating": 5, "text": "Really atmospheric place, I\u2019m curious to visit this spot when the weather will be warmer but this time it didn\u2019t interrupt us to sit outside with a glass of wine and beer and spend a great time :)"}, "Victoria Elgersma": {"rating": 2, "text": "Main reason for the poor review: as a paying customer, you have to pay to use the bathroom. How ridiculous is that?! I have never experienced this in my 3+ years in Berlin.\n\u20ac60 spent, and you have to pay to pee... There is nothing special about this bar, so I recommend going somewhere else where customers are valued."}, "Luka": {"rating": 4, "text": "atmosphere is phenomenal. the tables outside are placed a bit unfortunately (so if you're less than 6 people you'll likely be sharing your bench), but other than that it's gorgeous!"}, "Joanna": {"rating": 5, "text": "Actually pretty spacious and chill both inside and outside. The outside area is in the middle of a graffiti covered alley that must scratch the Berlin itch. The inside is actually quite subdued and clean. There is also a smoking room inside segregated from the rest of the sitting space. Service was very slow so be prepared to que up."}}}
