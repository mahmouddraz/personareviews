We tried the breakfast  and we liked it. You have to try the desert too."}, "Ian Law-Smith": {"rating": 4, "text": "Was recommended to try this cafe & not disappointed. Had the Irish coffee & home made strawberry cake. Very reasonably priced but the best bit was the waitress who despite being busy didn\u2019t stop smiling. Well worth a visit"}, "Stefano D'Onofrio": {"rating": 2, "text": "\u20ac14 for a soft-boiled egg on a slice of bread. Are you kidding me? The lentil soup is supposed to come with bread and butter, but they don\u2019t bring the butter. I have to go and ask for it, and the waitress says, \"But there\u2019s no butter.\" I show her the menu, and she looks at it in surprise. To be fair, the food is good, but the service is incredibly slow (after 35 minutes of waiting to order the desserts, we decided to leave), and the prices are outrageous."}, "Mathias Mellgren": {"rating": 5, "text": "Nice Place for breakfast, brunch, lunch or a cup of coffe. Classic Berlin!"}, "Daiana Wolf": {"rating": 5, "text": "The location is very nice. We will definitely come back again."}}}
