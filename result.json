{"restaurant_name": "Starbucks", "overall_rating": 3.9, "reviews": {"Don Pokocha": {"rating": 4, "text": "Conveniently located, just in front of Stadtmitte underground station. Tasted as good as other branches. But there were quite a few customers and it was hard to get a table."}, "Ainhoa 17": {"rating": 1, "text": "I came here with my family, and the staff was very rude. We only asked what time they close, but both workers at the counter were unfriendly and insisted we take our order to go because they didn\u2019t want to run the dishwasher. Additionally, while the staff was dancing and laughing, the place was dirty. Poor service. As someone who works in a customer-facing role, I don\u2019t think this is the way customers should be treated. We visited on 9/11/2024 at 19:30"}, "Thiya Damayanti": {"rating": 4, "text": "They are so friendly but could you at least clean the table or the corner of the sofa maybe, because it\u2019s so dusty and super dirty."}, "Niklas Schaefer": {"rating": 1, "text": "With that level of pricing, I would at least expect a little cleanness but most of all staff that doesn\u2019t make you feel like you are disturbing their private talks - been there twice and both times showing \u201cattitude\u201d. No, thanks!"}, "pluto mushshroom": {"rating": 5, "text": "I was there with a few friends and besides the muffins being a little dry we had a good time. The person at the register recommend us some drinks that all of us liked and the sandwichs were also very nice. Overall it was very comfortable and clean with friendly and helpful staff."}}}
