The coffee was great as were the cake and pastries. The vibe was relaxed and lively at the same time.  What was exceptional was the staff, so friendly and kind to non German speakers. We were made very welcome. We loved it and would return any time we could."}, "Kuo William": {"rating": 5, "text": "Cute little coffee shop that some hipsters go. Ordered an Americano here and the coffee is great"}}}
